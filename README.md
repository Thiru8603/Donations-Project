Questions and Analysis
Question 1: Typical Donor Profile
Description: The typical donor varies based on several factors including gift size, income, and time between gifts.
Findings: Donor attributes include age, income, wealth, and donation history. Key statistics show that the average age is 61.73, with varying donation sizes and frequencies.
Question 2: Percentage of Female Donors
Description: Analyzing the proportion of female donors in the sample.
Findings: 55.92% of donors are female (671 out of 1200), indicating a higher female contribution compared to males.
Question 3: Average Donation Analysis
Description: Assessing the average donation amounts for different categories.

Findings:

Average donation for smallest gift: 7.28
Average donation for largest gift: 19.31
Average donation for previous gift: 16.27
Average donation for current gift: 9.73
For current donors:

Average donation for smallest gift: 6.73
Average donation for largest gift: 19.31
Average donation for previous gift: 15.49
Average donation for current gift: 16.15
Question 4: Correlation Between Gift Frequency and Gift Size
Description: Investigating whether more frequent donors give smaller gifts.
Findings: The correlation between the time between gifts and smallest gift is 0.013, suggesting that donation frequency does not strongly impact the size of gifts.
Question 5: Variables Associated with Donation Amount
Description: Identifying variables correlated with the amount donated during the current campaign.
Findings: The strongest associations with current donation amounts are with the current gift and previous gift, with a correlation of 0.423.
Question 6: Recommendations for the Organization
Description: Providing insights and advice based on the data analysis.
Recommendations: Focus on encouraging larger-scale donations, consider generating income from donated products, and leverage insights to improve donation strategies.
Reflection
This case study provides insights into donor behavior and donation patterns. It highlights the significant role of female donors, the variability in donation sizes, and the factors influencing donation amounts. The analysis also reveals that current and previous gifts have strong associations with donation amounts.
